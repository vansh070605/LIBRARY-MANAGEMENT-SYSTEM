### Library Management System

This is a simple **Library Management System** developed using **Java Swing**. The system allows users to manage a collection of books, including functionalities to add, update, remove, and search for books in a library.

#### Features:
- **Add Book**: Allows adding new books with details like title, author, ISBN, publication year, genre, and availability status.
- **Update Book**: Enables editing the details of an existing book.
- **Remove Book**: Removes a selected book from the library collection.
- **Search**: Provides search functionality to search books by title or author.
- **Book Table**: Displays a list of books in a table format with details such as title, author, ISBN, genre, and availability.
- **Tabbed Interface**: Utilizes a tabbed interface to separate book details and the book list.
- **Toolbar and Menu Bar**: Provides easy access to actions via toolbar buttons and menu options.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: Core language for application logic.
- **Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Collections**: Data is managed using ArrayList and HashMap to store and manipulate book details.

#### How to Use:
1. **Run the application** to launch the Library Management System.
2. Use the **"Add Book"** and **"Update Book"** buttons to manage books.
3. Search for books using the **"Search"** functionality in the "Book List" tab.
4. Books can be removed by selecting a row and clicking the **"Remove Book"** button.

This project is designed to be simple yet functional, and can be expanded further to include additional features such as persistent storage (e.g., saving data to a database or file).
